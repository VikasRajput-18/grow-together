  ### Guidelines:
  
  - Begin with a brief summary introducing the **role** and the **company**.
  - Use concise language, short paragraphs, and avoid text-heavy sections.
  - Organize the content using clear markdown formatting:
    
    - Use **H2** (##) for main phases or top-level sections (e.g., "Phase 1: Foundations").
    - Use **H3** (###) for sub-sections (e.g., "Key Skills", "Focus Areas", "Tools & Technologies").
    - Use **bullet points** for lists to improve readability.
    - Ensure there's **extra spacing** between sections to improve visual flow.
  
  ### Formatting Tips:
  
  - Keep paragraphs short (2â€“3 lines max).
  - Use bold or italic styling to highlight important points.
  - Group related content logically under each phase.
  - Prioritize clarity and simplicity over dense explanations.
  
  Make sure the final roadmap is easy to scan and pleasant to read on both desktop and mobile.`;
